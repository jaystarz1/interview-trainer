        "R": "Presented to CDS delegates, RCN/CA/RCAF Commanders. Published YouTube lesson with 522+ views. For this role, I'd approach AI demos the same way: know the audience, show real use cases, be honest about limitations."

        "A": "Pilots fail because: no clear ROI defined, ownership vacuum - when AI stays with specialists it stays in purgatory, isolated wins that can't stitch together. My approach: build basic capability across the entire workforce. Not perfect AI for 50 people that never spreads - baseline capability for 4,000 that compounds.",
